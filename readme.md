<h1>Hellu</h1>
My name is TheRealOne and this is a public project.

<h2>What is this program?</h2>
It's a calculator. It's actually my first code I started when I was 5th grade, and yes, my first ever program wasn't a hello world program.

I finally made it to compile after all this years of being forgotten in a old hard drive.

So... now I made possible for you to use it :)

Now you will probably hate me because you probably hate math, but I hate math too so ... idk ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

<h2>What language was this program created</h2>

Since this was most realible and the language I know well, it was written in C++ with a little help of ``system()``.

<h2>How do I do to make this work?</h2>
First you need to download the code. You can type ``git clone https://github.com/3lia78/calculator.git`` in your git terminal at your specific directory, or you can download using the ``download zip`` button via ``Code`` button.

Second you need to compile it using a compilator.
A compilator is the program that translates human code, in this example C++, into PC binary code that an Operating System can understand.
More about compiling at Compiling section.

<h2>Compiling...</h2>

You need first to download a C++ compiler. If you are a linux user, most probably you have already installed a GCC compiler. You can verify it by typing ``whereis G++`` in your terminal. If you don't you can download it with ``sudo apt-get install G++`` command.
In windows, you can install the free version MinGW GCC <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">here</a>.
Install the MINGW manager, and install the G++ basic compiler.
After that, you might or not want to path it to the system. To path it, in cmd run ``setx path "%PATH%;path_you_installed_mingw\\bin".
After that you can run it.
BTW, make sure you download all files.
