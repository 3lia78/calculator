Hello
My name is TheRealOne and this is a public project.

It's a calculator. It's actually my first code I started when I was 5th grade, and yes, my first ever program wasn't a hello world program.

I finally made it to compile after all this years of being forgotten in a old hard drive.

So... now I made possible for you to use it :)

Now you will probably hate me because you probably hate math, but I hate math too so ... idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
